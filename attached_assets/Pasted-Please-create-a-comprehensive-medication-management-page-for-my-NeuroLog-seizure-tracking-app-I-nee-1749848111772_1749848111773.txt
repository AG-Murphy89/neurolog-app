Design Requirements:

Match the existing NeuroLog design (NHS blue #005EB8, white cards, rounded corners)
Mobile responsive layout
Same header/navigation as dashboard
Smooth animations and modern UI
Form validation and error handling

Data Structure:
Each medication should include:

Medication name
Generic name
Dose amount and unit (mg, ml, etc)

Specific times (AM: 8:00, Midday: 12:00, PM: 8:00)
Start date
Prescribing doctor name and contact
Pharmacy name and phone
Side effects experienced
Effectiveness rating (1-5)
Days supply remaining

Today's Schedule - AM/Midday/PM medication times with checkboxes
Current Medications - Cards showing each medication with key details
Add/Edit Medication Form - Comprehensive form for medication details
Medication History - Timeline of medication changes
Interactions Checker - Simple warnings about potential interactions

Technical Requirements:

Use React hooks (useState, useEffect)
Store data in localStorage for now (will integrate with Supabase later)
Form validation
Responsive design with CSS-in-JS styling
Export as default function
Include proper TypeScript types

UI Elements:

Medication cards with color-coded status (active, paused, discontinued)
Time-based scheduling grid
Progress bars for medication adherence
Icons for different medication types
Modal forms for adding/editing
Confirmation dialogs for deleting medications

Sample Medications to Pre-populate:
Include 2-3 example medications like:

Levetiracetam 500mg twice daily
Lamotrigine 100mg twice daily
Lorazepam 1mg as needed

Please make this a complete, functional page that matches the existing NeuroLog design system and includes all the features listed above. The page should be ready to use immediately and integrate with the existing navigation system.
