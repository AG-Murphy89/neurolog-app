### Page Sections:
1. **Header** - "NeuroLog Doctor Portal" with practice name and doctor info
2. **Quick Stats** - Total patients, active cases, alerts requiring attention
3. **Patient Overview** - Cards showing each patient with key metrics and status
4. **Alert Center** - Priority notifications for patient safety

- Alert notifications with priority levels
- Clinical notes interface with rich text editing
- Patient search and filtering tools
- Quick action buttons (call patient, send message, add note)
- Professional medical icons and status indicators

### Sample Data to Include:
Pre-populate with 5-8 example patients showing:

- Sample clinical notes and observations

### Revenue Integration:
- **Subscription Status** display (active/trial/expired)

Please make this a complete, professional medical portal that matches the existing NeuroLog design system but with enhanced clinical functionality. The portal should be ready for real doctors to use in clinical practice and include all necessary features for professional healthcare management.

Include proper TypeScript interfaces for all medical data structures and ensure the portal integrates seamlessly with the existing NeuroLog patient app database.
