COMPLETE SUPABASE INTEGRATION FOR NEUROLOG
I need you to fully integrate Supabase with my NeuroLog seizure tracking app. I have already:

Created a Supabase project with EU hosting (GDPR compliant)
Added my Supabase credentials to Replit Secrets
Created the database tables using SQL
Installed @supabase/supabase-js

Please complete these tasks:
1. UPDATE MEDICATION PAGE FOR SUPABASE
My medication.tsx file currently uses localStorage. Update it to:

Connect to the 'medications' table in Supabase
Add/edit/delete medications with proper error handling
Include medication reminders and scheduling
Match the NHS blue design of the rest of the app

2. UPDATE ANY OTHER PAGES USING LOCALSTORAGE
Find and update any other files that use localStorage to use Supabase instead:

Profile pages
CQC audit tracking
Any other data storage

3. ADD AUTHENTICATION FEATURES
Add these missing auth features:

Password reset functionality
Email verification handling
Proper error messages for auth failures
Session management improvements

4. ADD GDPR DATA EXPORT/IMPORT
Create functions for:

Export all user data as JSON (GDPR compliance)
Export medical reports as PDF
Data import functionality
Right to be forgotten implementation

5. ADD EMAIL INTEGRATION
Set up email functionality for:

Welcome emails for new users
Password reset emails
Medication reminder emails
Emergency notifications

6. ADD MEDICATION REMINDERS SYSTEM
Create a medication reminder system with:

Browser notifications for medication times
Daily/weekly schedules
Missed dose tracking
Visual medication calendar

7. ENHANCE ERROR HANDLING
Add comprehensive error handling throughout the app:

Network connection issues
Supabase errors
User-friendly error messages
Offline mode detection

8. ADD DATA VALIDATION
Implement data validation for:

Form inputs
Date ranges
Required fields
Data integrity checks

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Use TypeScript throughout
Maintain NHS blue design (#005EB8)
Ensure GDPR compliance
Add proper loading states
Include success/error notifications
Mobile responsive design
Follow existing code patterns

EXISTING STRUCTURE:

lib/supabase.ts exists and works
Dashboard.tsx is fully integrated with Supabase
Landing page (index.tsx) has Supabase auth
Database tables are created and RLS is enabled

Please implement these changes systematically, ensuring each feature works properly before moving to the next. Focus on making NeuroLog a production-ready healthcare application.
